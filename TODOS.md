- add support for rss!
- add support for embedding gists and youtube vids right in the blog
- sessions and logging in!
- make it easy to migrate from wordpress? See:
    obtvse/lib/tasks/migrate_wordpress.rake

- comments

- prettier 404 and 500 error pages

- needed: a sass parser for haskell so I can write an asset aggregator in pure haskell
- rss

- write a page /import where you tell me the connection to your obtvse db and I automatically import all of your posts

- I prefer a static site, maybe I should change this to that?

Put config into config.yml instead
